As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters builds an Elastigroup with Intelligent Traffic Flow and Predictive auto scaling feature enabled. The ITF feature will ensure effective CPU utilization among variety of instance types by distributing the traffic to target groups based on the number of vCPUs. The Predictive auto scaling utilizes machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the CPU pattern of your workloads and scale in advance of your demand. 


* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
** Spot Elastigroup with Intelligent Traffic Flow and Predictive Autoscaling features enabled

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.


//[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
